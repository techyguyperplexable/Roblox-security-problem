# Roblox-security-problem
Okay okay
So you think roblox is so safe right?
think again
They do not use cloudflare, instead they use on premises servers, using ubuntu
This Ubuntu version? 20.04 LTS
secure? not really
Vulns? there are a lot of vulns,
ios security is practically non existent on main client.
right, roblox on linux is worse with Their APOkI being fucked

# What benefits soloware

easier to make API and executor
Insecure servers (sort of)
Ok I'm done
